# image-repository

This is a public image repository application using express for the backend server to handle requests and react for the front end to display the content

I used Cloudinary as a image hosting container to store and retrieve the images

You can look through the backend and frontend folders for more specifics of what happens inside the application

Check out the application on Heroku for a live demo: https://afternoon-citadel-36468.herokuapp.com/
